    <p>
        My name is Ivymarie V. Aurellana, and I am a 19-year-old first-year college student 
        taking up Bachelor of Secondary Education, Major in English. I chose this course 
        because I have a deep interest in language, literature, and communication. I believe 
        that becoming an English teacher will allow me to inspire students to express 
        themselves confidently and think critically.
    </p>

    <p>
        My motto in life is "Follow your dreams, they know the way" because I believe 
        that our dreams guide us toward our true purpose. Even though college life can 
        be challenging, I stay motivated by reminding myself why I started. I am determined 
        to finish my degree, grow both personally and professionally, and one day become 
        a teacher who makes a positive difference in the lives of students.
    </p>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To inspire students to appreciate literature and language.</li>
        <li>To become a patient, understanding, and effective teacher.</li>
        <li>To continue learning and growing both personally and professionally.</li>
    </ol>
